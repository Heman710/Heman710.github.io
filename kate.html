        My sister, Kate, is definitely not your typical girl. Sure, she does her nails and jams out to Ariana Grande, but Kate is into some really cool things. First of all, Kate is an excellent ski racer. She knows how to rip a turn and isn't afraid to drop down into a tuck. If you ask me, she's destined for some big podium finishes in the near future. She also dominates soccer, normally making members of the other team cry on the field.

        Jokes aside, Kate's actually a really sweet and funny girl. She impresses me with her maturity and genuinely makes me laugh all the time. She's only ten, but I'm certain Kate's destined for great things.
