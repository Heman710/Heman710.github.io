        Tiko does not care for your input. If he decides he wants to do something, he's going to do it regardless of your concerns. His parents don't enjoy this, but I think we could all learn something from Nick's lack of shame. His audacity really comes out on the slopes. He lays down some absolutely sick turns and is probably the best racer out of all three of us. He's already winning races and sends it off ski jumps on the reg.

        While Tiko enjoys racing, he finds that it distracts him from his ultimate goal of world domination. His dad reads him Mein Kampf every night before bedtime and Nick plans on beginning his military coup d'etat in 2018. As of now, Nick remains a big-time savage with particularly good taste in structured hats.
